Azores Islands Beach Weather Tracker

Summary:

The app is about weather and news from azores that are always good,
we can see if weather it´s good or not to go to the beach. and see some news on the beach.

Motivation:

My motivation to create this app it´s because as i live in an island,
it´s very dificult to use app´s to see weather on islands.
